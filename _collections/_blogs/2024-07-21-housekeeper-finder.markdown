        Apple today named eight app and game developers receiving an Apple Design Award, each one
        selected for being thoughtful and creative. Apple Design Award winners bring distinctive
        new ideas to life and demonstrate deep mastery of Apple technology. The apps spring up
        from developers large and small, in every part of the world, and provide users with new
        ways of working, creating, and playing.

        “Every year, app and game developers demonstrate exceptional craftsmanship and we’re
        honoring the best of the best,” said Ron Okamoto, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide
        Developer Relations. “Receiving an Apple Design Award is a special and laudable
        accomplishment. Past honorees have made some of the most noteworthy apps and games of
        all time. Through their vision, determination, and exacting standards, the winning
        developers inspire not only their peers in the Apple developer community, but all of us
        at Apple, too.”
